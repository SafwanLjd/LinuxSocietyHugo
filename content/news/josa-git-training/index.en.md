## What is Git?
Git is a vital version control system used for tracking changes in files and coordinating work among teams. It enables efficient management of various versions of a project through branching and merging, making it crucial for non-linear development.

Key to Git's ecosystem are platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), which offer web-based hosting for Git repositories. These services not only store projects but also provide tools for collaboration, issue tracking, and code sharing, making them indispensable in modern software development.

## What is JOSA?
> The Jordan Open Source Association (JOSA) is a non-profit organisation based in Amman, Jordan. The association is among the few non-profits registered under the Jordan Ministry of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship.

> JOSA’s mission is to promote openness in technology and to defend the rights of technology users in Jordan. We believe that information that is non-personal – whether it’s software code, hardware design blueprints, data, network protocols and architecture, content – should be free for everyone to view, use, share, and modify. Our belief also holds that information that is personal should be protected within legal and technological frameworks. Access to the modern Web should likewise remain open.
