## What's FOSS?
FOSS stands for "Free and Open Source Software", which means software that's not only free to use but also open for anyone to tinker with, customize, or even distribute. It is a community-driven approach to software development, where the code is transparent and contributions are a collaborative effort.

## why should I use FOSS?

Switching to FOSS alternatives is a smart move for several reasons:

- **Cost**: FOSS is and will always be free, you will never have to bother with subscriptions or corporations changing pricings or policies on a whim. This can save you a ton of money on the long run, even if the cost of proprietary software is negligible for you.
- **Portability**: Having access to the source code means that you can run the software on any device you can compile to, so no more of "This program runs only on X device and Y operating system" problems, you can even run the programs on a smart fridge or a toaster if you know how to.
- **Quality**: FOSS programs with  big userbases have higher quality than proprietary software, because it is subject to peer review, testing, and feedback from a large and diverse community of developers and users, if you find a bug and know how to fix it you can just do so, instead of sending a report and hoping that some developer might know how.
- **security**: Software tends to be more secure and stable when developed as a FOSS project, because bugs and vulnerabilities are quickly detected and fixed, and malicious code and backdoors are unlikely to survive in an open development environment.
- **Room for Innovation**: Do you have an idea?  you can request it or implement it by yourself  if you know how. Do you not like the direction in which the software is being developed towards? You can fork the project and develop it into a different direction, this often happens and results in many new interesting programs.
- **Learning**: Ever wondered how does some software work? Now with FOSS you can! It's a goldmine for learning and honing your tech skills.

## FOSS Alternatives to Popular Software
Now, let's talk alternatives. From operating systems to web browsers to media players, FOSS has got you covered. Here we are listing a few:

- **Linux**: The most successful FOSS software, runs on everything from your personal phones to the world's biggest servers.
- **Firefox**: A trusted and well-known browser. Without it we would have Google's monopoly on browsers because the majority of browsers are built on chromium.
- **VLC**: A powerful media player, it can play any video you can find.
- **Visual Studio Code**: A source code editor developed by Microsoft, it's a very popular choice by developers.
- **GIMP**: A multi-purpose image editor software that is comparable to Photoshop.
- **Krita**: Unlike GIMP, Krita is a  software designed for digital painting and illustration.
- **Kdenlive**: A free and open-source video editing software.
- **Blender**: A powerhouse and feature-rich software for 3D modeling and animation.
- And many more covering areas like video editing, audio recording, file compression, password management, and more.
